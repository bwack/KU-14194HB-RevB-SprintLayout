# KU-14194HB-RevB-SprintLayout
C64 Motherboard traced in blood and sweat

The gerber files are not shared here because this SprintLayout design isn't verified and like my KiCad project, by a long run ! So please refer to the kicad project if you need a board that is a complete replica that I have verified with schematics, netlist and prototype. I share the sprintlayout files anyway. Just beware that it is not a good idea to order boards from this design.
